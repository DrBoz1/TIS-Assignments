<h3 align="centre">ASSIGNMENTS REFLECTION</h3>

<h3 align="left">Reflection on Industrial Talk-1 (Clarity Techworks) Assignment:</h3>
<h3 align="left">Examining Clarity Techworks and its ICT employment prospects has given me important insights into the always shifting field of technology roles. The need of keeping up with technology developments, realising that practical skills are critical for success, and adopting an attitude of constant learning and adaptation are among the most important lessons learned. This experience emphasises how the IT sector is always changing and how proactive skill development is necessary to guarantee a safe and fulfilling career in information and communications technology.</h3>


<h3 align="left">Reflection on Virtual Talk (UTM Digital) Assignment:</h3>
<h3 align="left">﻿Taking part in UTMdigital events has been educational. The practical experience with ICT services, digital infrastructure, and state-of-the-art technology has enabled the conversion of academic understanding into actionable insights. All things considered, these endeavours have enhanced our educational path by providing a more profound comprehension of the practical uses of digital technology and encouraging a stronger admiration for their significance in higher education.</h3>


<h3 align="left">Reflection on Industrial Talk-2 (Credence) Assignment:</h3>
<h3 align="left">In light of the observations and goals made by colleagues, I envision the next four years as a revolutionary path for system growth. As AI becomes more and more prevalent—as seen by developments like ChatGPT—people recognise the value of ongoing self-education. In my opinion, it makes sense to actively engage in continuing education in order to get ready for the changing job of a system developer.</h3>


 <h3 align="left">Reflection on Indah Water Visit Assignment:</h3>
 <h3 align="left">An insightful viewpoint on the real-world uses of software engineering outside of traditional app development professions was provided by the tour to the Indah Water Konsortium. The variety of employment choices accessible to graduates was demonstrated by watching the integration of hardware and software to operate a sewage system. Seeing how software engineers support environmental solutions—like water treatment—opened my eyes to the wider range of uses for their skills. The journey provided hope by demonstrating how software engineering can help solve real-world problems and create a more sustainable society.</h3>

  <h3 align="left">Design Thinking Reflection:</h3>
  <h3 align="left">The value of simplicity and user-friendly design has been highlighted by this project, particularly when it comes to improving the user experience for a personalised diet. Working together with possible users brought to light the importance of customised features and the adaptability of the design process. Notably, creating exercise regimens and streamlining the registration and login processes were given top priority in order to improve accessibility. As the project moves towards higher-fidelity prototypes, these findings will direct additional changes that will eventually result in a website that guarantees seamless user interactions while improving diet and exercise planning.</h3>

  
<h3 align="left">PC Assembly Reflection:</h3>
<h3 align="left">I developed my flexibility, attention to detail, and problem-solving abilities via the process of building and dismantling PCs. Managing the little parts highlighted the importance of having a thorough grasp and exposed the hardware's complexity. Playing with real gear was a welcome diversion from our ever more virtual environment.
